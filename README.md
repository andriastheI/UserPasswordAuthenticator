User Password Authenticator

This is the first simple project.
I am forcing myself to learn how to code in java with simple(mini) projects
I will start with the easy one and work my way up.

This Project will be console based project, simple not complicated. that will ask
a user to create a user name and password. then store it in an encripted format.
the user and passwor are saved in a temporary map, that can be authenticated as well.

I know is it dumb. but you gotta start from somewhere.
